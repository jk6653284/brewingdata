* `grep` command in UNIX system: bascially, it's a way to filter search for file for particular pattern. The result can be listed, or just even be counted (to see if any matches exist). Basic pattern is `grep [options] pattern [files]`, where options can be things like `-c`(count of matched results) and `-n`(print out matched results).
