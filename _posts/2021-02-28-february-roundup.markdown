### Summary
This month was a little chaotic. I wasn't able to follow my daily habits very well, and for the reason I'm also extending the February project until March. But I've put time and effort into other important things and happy with what I've achieved this month. If anything, I feel like I'm improved personally, and that's why I somehow skipped a lot of meditation sessions. Need to stick back to plan in March a little better.
